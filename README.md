# Enigma Vault

This repo houses all the bite-sized “enigmas” I tinker with—puzzles, reference solutions, and grading harnesses bundled per folder. Jump into any subdirectory (e.g., `wordmaze/`) to find:
- the problem statement and contest rules
- ready-to-run graders/tests

Treat each folder as its own sandbox. Clone, explore, and adapt the enigmas however you like.
